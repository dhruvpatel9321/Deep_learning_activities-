    "**So what is a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function groups a set of statements together to run the statements more than once. It allows us to specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow us to reuse the code instead of writing the code again and again. If you recall strings and lists, remember that len() function is used to find the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task, you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function is one of the most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design."

    "We begin with def then a space followed by the name of the function. Try to keep names relevant and simple as possible, for example, len() is a good name for a length() function. Also be careful with names, you wouldn't want to call a function the same name as a [built-in function in Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) (such as len).\n",

    "Next, comes the number of arguments separated by a comma within a pair of parenthesis which acts as input to the defined function,  reference them and the function definition with a colon.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Next, you'll see the doc-string where you write the basic description of the function. Using iPython and iPython Notebooks, you'll be able to read these doc-strings by pressing Shift+Tab after a function name. It is not mandatory to include docstrings with simple functions, but it is a good practice to put them as this will help the programmers to easily understand the code you write.\n",
