    "\n",
    "The code that is executed when a specific condition is met is defined in a \"block.\" In Python, the block structure is signalled by changes in indentation. Each line of code in a certain block level must be indented equally and indented more than the surrounding scope. The standard (defined in PEP-8) is to use 4 spaces for each level of block indentation. Statements preceding blocks generally end with a colon (:).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are no semi-colons or other end-of-line indicators in Python, breaking lines of code requires either a continuation character (\\ as the last char) or for the break to occur inside an unfinished structure (such as open parentheses).\n",

    "One of the great advantages of Python as a programming language is the ease with which it allows you to manipulate containers. Containers (or collections) are an integral part of the language and, as you’ll see, built in to the core of the language’s syntax. As a result, thinking in a Pythonic manner means thinking about containers.\n",
